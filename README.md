##Running the project 
This app is created using Vitejs and react, if you want to start the dev server you will need to run the command:
```
npm run dev
```

## Demo

## Technogies 
- Sass
- Node Sass
- ViteJS as the bundler  
- TypeScript

## Infinite scroll 

The infinite scroll was implemented by using the Iintersection observer API, I choose this over the traditional method of adding an event lister on the scroll due to performance reasons. 

## ViteJS 
I like working with Vite mainly because it is very lightweight and provides a faster development experience. 

## Typescript 
I choose TypeScript because of the Predictability, Readability and Rich IDE support that comes with it.
